BikeRoute is currently looking for a new maintainer, because I no longer have time to work on it. Do please get in touch if you'd be interested.


BikeRoute is an android platform application providing gps-based route planning and directions using data from OpenStreetMap and a selection of routing providers (Cyclestreets.net in the UK, Google cycle directions in the US,  and MapQuest worldwide).
